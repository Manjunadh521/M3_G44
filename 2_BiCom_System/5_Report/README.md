# 1 About the BiCom System
## 1.1 Description
* This project is an BiCom System. This system Displays Window Status, Alarm Status, Battery Information, Door Status . There is a led signaling which helps us to identify the features. For example if we press a button 1 time all the LED will be on which means the Window status of car is displayng, similarly for 2, 3 and 4 clicks. There are several features like communication between car to key and key to car .

## 1.2 Identifying features
* It shall display window satus of car for one User Button Click
* It shall display alarm satus of car Two User Button Clicks 
* It shall display battery information of car for Three User Button Clicks 
* It shall display door satus of car for Four User Button Clicks 
---
## 1.3 State of art
* Buttons shall be provided to ease the access of available features.
* Window status of the car is displayed with a button press.
* Alarm status of the car is displayed with a button press.
* Battery status of the car is displayed with a button press.
* Display status of the car is displayed with a button press.
