# 1 About Remote KeyLess Entry(R.K.E)
## 1.1 Description
* This project is an Remote keyless entry(R.K.E). This system helps to Lock the car, Unlock the car, Alarm activation/deactivation and Light Focus if anyone approaches near. There is a led signaling which helps us to identify the features. For example if we press a button 1 time all the LED will be on which means we locked the car and similarly fonr 2, 3 and 4 clicks. There are several features like heavy encription by providing rolling code algorithm to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams. .

## 1.2 Identifying features
* It shall Lock the car for one User Button Click
* It shall Unlock the car Two User Button Clicks 
* It shall activation/deactivation alarm for Three User Button Clicks 
* It shall activate approach light for Four User Button Clicks 
---
## 1.3 State of art
* Buttons shall be provided to ease the access of available features.
* Lock and Unlock the car with a button press.
* Alarm system and Approach light are also available with a button press.
* Hack proof security is provided with encription.

# 4.1 HIGH LEVEL TEST PLAN

| Test ID | Description | Input | Expected output | Actual Output | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 01 | Car Lock | 1 User Button Press | Car locked |  Car locked  | 
| 02 | Car Unlock | 2 User Button Presses |  Car unlocked  |  Car unlocked  | 
| 03 | Alarm activation/deactivation | 3 User Button Presses | Alarm activated/deactivated | Alarm activated/deactivated | 
| 04 | Approach Light | 4 User Button Presses | Approch Light On | Approach Light On | 
| 05 | Data Encryption | No of User Clicks | Random Data | Random Data | 
### Here below are the some of the *unity test/ unity framework* test plans there are so many but I have only mentiones some of the test cases here.
